# Modular Ability Combat Framework (Unity)

A Unity combat framework built to explore reusable gameplay systems and combat architecture.

The goal of this project is to create abilities that can be added, modified, and combined through configuration rather than rewriting gameplay code.

# Development Process

# 🧠 Core Idea

The framework separates combat into three independent concerns:

* **Abilities** = What the player uses
* **Delivery** = How the ability reaches targets
* **Effects** = What gameplay outcome occurs

This makes it easier to create new abilities by reusing existing systems instead of writing new code for every ability.

# 🎯 System Responsibilities

Each system has a single responsibility within the ability pipeline.

| System                     | Responsibility                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------                             |
| PlayerAbilityController    | Reads player input and starts ability flow                                         |
| AbilityCast                | Temporary confirm-cast lifecycle                                                   |
| AbilityTargetingCalculator | Builds AbilityTargetingData from resolver output                                   |
| AbilityTargetingData       | Stores targeting information for the current cast                                  |
| AbilityTargetResolver      | Raw camera/world queries                                                           |
| AbilityUser                | Starts ability execution and cooldowns                                             |
| AbilityTargetingAdjuster   | Adjusts targeting before validation (for example, clamping point targets to range) |
| AbilityValidator           | Checks cooldowns and whether the requested target is valid                         |
| Delivery Strategies        | Spawns projectile only                                                             |
| Projectile                 | Projectile movement, collision detection, and creation of ImpactData               |
| InstantDelivery            | Determines affected targets                                                        |
| AbilityImpactExecutor      | Resolves impacts, calculates effect multipliers, and applies effects               |
| Effects                    | Apply gameplay outcomes                                                            |


Design Rule:

* Systems own one responsibility.
* Gameplay effects never bypass the effect system.

# ⚙️ System Overview

## 1. Ability Layer

Abilities are stored as ScriptableObjects.

An ability defines:

* Targeting Type (Point / Target / Self)
* Cast Mode (Instant / Confirm)
* Delivery Type (Instant / Projectile / Delayed / Chain)
* Area Shape (None / Sphere / Cone)
* Effect List

Abilities contain configuration only.

They do not contain gameplay logic.

---

## 2. Targeting Layer

The targeting system determines where an ability should be used and which targets are valid.

Responsibilities include:

* Aim direction calculation
* Aim point calculation
* Target detection
* Building AbilityTargetingData

Targeting information is stored in AbilityTargetingData and passed through the execution pipeline.

---

## 3. Cast Layer

Abilities using Confirm Cast create a temporary AbilityCast instance.

Responsibilities include:

* Maintaining cast state
* Updating targeting information
* Displaying targeting indicators
* Confirming or cancelling casts

This system only exists while the player is preparing a confirm-cast ability.

---

## 4. Delivery Layer

Delivery determines how an ability reaches its targets.

Current delivery types:

### Instant

Resolves immediately.

### Projectile

Spawns a projectile and resolves on impact.

### Delayed

Waits before resolving.

### Chain

Transfers effects between valid targets.

---

## 5. Validation Layer

AbilityValidator determines whether an ability can proceed.

Responsiblities include:

* Cooldown validation
* Target validation
* Cast confirmation validation

---
## 6. Impact Layer

Delivery systems convert AbilityTargetingData into ImpactData once an impact location has been finalized. ImpactData represents the actual gameplay impact context consumed by the effect pipeline.

---

## 7. Effect Layer

Effects define gameplay outcomes.

Current examples:

* Damage
* Heal
* Slow

Design Rule:

Effects are the only systems allowed to directly modify gameplay state.
Effects operate only on finalized ImpactData, remaining independent of how an ability was delivered.

---

# 🧪 Design Goals

This project is intended as a gameplay systems portfolio project.

The primary goals are:

* Build reusable gameplay systems
* Practice clean system architecture
* Build systems with clear responsibilities
* Create a consistent ability workflow
* Support extension without modifying core systems

---

# 🚧 Future Improvements

* Buff / debuff framework
* Status effect system
* Animation-driven ability execution
* Advanced cast interruption framework
* Gameplay tags and ability requirements
* AI integration using the same ability pipeline

---

# 📌 Summary

Abilities define configuration.

Targeting determines intent.

Delivery determines how abilities execute.

Effects determine gameplay outcomes.

The result is a modular combat framework that can be extended with new abilities while minimizing changes to existing systems.

# Why I Built This

I enjoy building gameplay systems and understanding how different combat mechanics fit together.

Many games contain abilities, cooldowns, projectiles, targeting systems, status effects, and execution pipelines. Rather than implementing each ability as a one-off solution, I wanted to explore how these mechanics could be built from reusable systems.

This project started as an experiment to see how a reusable combat system could be built. Along the way, it became a way to practice gameplay programming, system design, and building systems that are easy to extend.

One interesting side effect is that I now analyze abilities in games differently. When playing games such as Overwatch or League of Legends, I often find myself breaking abilities down into targeting, delivery, and effect layers and thinking about how they could be implemented within a reusable framework.
